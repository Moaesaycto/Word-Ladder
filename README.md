# Word Ladder

A word ladder is a connection from one word to another, formed by changing one
letter at a time, with the constraint that each transformation yields a new valid word. For example,
here is a word ladder connecting "code" to "data".

```txt
code -> cade -> cate -> date -> data
```

Many word ladders will have multiple solutions, such as connecting "work" to "play".

```txt
work fork form foam flam flay play
work pork perk peak pean plan play
work pork perk peak peat plat play
work pork perk pert peat plat play
work pork porn pirn pian plan play
work pork port pert peat plat play
work word wood pood plod ploy play
work worm form foam flam flay play
work worn porn pirn pian plan play
work wort bort boat blat plat play
work wort port pert peat plat play
work wort wert pert peat plat play
```

This project takes a start word, a destination word, and a lexicon, and returns a vector of valid word ladders. By using [breadth-first search][bfs], we can find solutions without an issue.
